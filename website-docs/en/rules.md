# The rules of RealistikOsu

- **Exploiting any tablet drivers "features" how some people would say (eg. anti-chatter) is strictly prohibited and will result in 3rd strike in Punishment System** (read more about it below.)

- The usage of any external modifications that alter the behaviour of the client (such as cheating software, custom clients) is strictly prohibited.

- The creation of alternate accounts (multiaccounting) is prohibited and will result in the banning of the multiaccount and the restriction of your main account.

- The impersonation of other players will result in your name being changed.

- The sharing of accounts is prohibited and will result in the restriction of both parties.

- Including any kind of NSFW content within your avatar/banner will result in an instant ban.

We reserve the right to apply and alter these rules as we see fit.

## Requirements for a valid liveplay.
If the staff team believes you to be suspicious, you may be requested to produce a liveplay. A liveplay is a way of confirming one's skill is legitimate and verifying the absence of cheats. 

- You **HAVE** to be logged into RealistikOsu! 
- Start **your PC** on the recording/stream
- Make sure both your hands are visible and monitor
- Try to repeat any of your topplays/play near your skill (unless you are specifically given maps to play)
- You must play at least 3 maps in the liveplay
- The entire GUI must be visible (key overlay, hit error bar (must be on hit error and not colour), score etc.)
- Show Task Manager after opening osu! and at the end of the liveplay
- Edited liveplays will automatically be disqualified
- Everything must be in a single recording
- You must use [our patcher](https://ussr.pl/patcher)

Note: Failure to meet even a single of the specified requirements will result in your liveplay being automatically invalidated.

## Punishment System
This is how the RealistikOsu punishment system works.

**Cheating Punishments**
Cheating now uses a 3 strike system.

**1st time:** 1 month long restriction + wipe of the cheated gamemodes
**2nd time:** 3 month restriction + full wipe of the account
**3rd time:** Permanent but appealable ban

**Multiaccounting**
Multiaccounting adopts a similar system to cheating. Every single time will result with the permanent ban of the multiaccount.

**1st time:** 15 day restriction on the main account
**2nd time:** 1-1.5 month restriction on the main account
**3rd time:** Permanent but appealable restriction on the main account

**In-game Toxicity**

Each case of toxicity that is seen as going  over the line will be met with an in-game silence (and Discord mute if it occurs here). The silence times will increase exponentially and will begin at 1 hour.
